# Introduction

Take your forms to the next level with Simpleforms.js: a powerful, lightweight and fully customisable library to get your forms validated and sanitised with ease through the use of existing validation methods and your custom ones.

Simpleforms.js is aimed towards frontend developers who are tired of rewriting the same old logic to handle form validation. This library doesn't come with any CSS and does not insert any HTML into your forms, so you have the most flexible frontend developemnt experience.
